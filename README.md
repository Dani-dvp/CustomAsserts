# CustomAsserts
This is a library with Custom Asserts. Its intension is to be used as a nuGet package and make it easier to test specific banking information with already completed Assert methods. Such as for a card, payments or a user.
The Asserts are sorted for their specific tasks. We also have an example test class that show you how they work and that they work (The failures are intentional to preview what error messages you get).

Use the Asserts in your own tests! Happy testing!
